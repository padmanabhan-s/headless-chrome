# headless-chrome

 ## What is headless Browser:
            Headless browser are browser without GUI ( Graphical User Interface ).This browser are used in testing environment to calculate graphic rendering speed.
## Not only chrome:
            Most of the browsers are can be made as headless.
## Requirement:
            To control the browser with PYTHON we need 
            * selenium and 
            * corresponding webdriver for the browser.
## I used:
        I  used Python version 3.6 eventhough python version 2 also support selenium but the maintainence for version 2 is stopped in 2020.
